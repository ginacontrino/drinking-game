### This is my game! :D

After cloning the repo and running 'npm install',
simply run the following command in the terminal to play:

    node Game.js

The goal of the game is to NOT guess some 'secret number' which is chosen,
at random, by the game between 1 and 100 (100 is the default maximum).
To make the game harder or easier, you can optionally set the maximum number
yourself using the following:

    node Game.js --max <some number>

You take turns guessing until someone guesses the secret number.
As a hint the game tells you whether your number is too high or too low,
and you will be penalised if you do not follow the hints correctly.

When someone finally guesses the secret number then they lose and must have a shot!

Enjoy.

Note: This game will be under constant development, so stay tuned...
